## What is Angular Three (NGT) ?

NGT is a **Component Library** that wraps around [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) to provide a declarative approach to building 3D applications using [Angular](https://angular.io/) capabilities.

## Why is it good to use NGT ?

NGT allows the consumers to utilize Template-less Directives to build 3D scenes declaratively with access to Angular Dependency Injection, Inputs, Outputs, and other standard features.

## How does NGT work?

NGT relies heavily on [Hierarchical Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection) to allow for declarative creation of THREE.js objects on the template.

## What is the difference between NGT and React Three Fiber?

Many points in comparison with R3F, which are listed here, in [Svelte Cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/docs/faqs#how-is-it-different-from-x-react-three-fiber) (a Svelte-based THREE.js library) also applies to NGT.

[React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (R3F) is a **Renderer** that treats THREE.js as native elements. Hence, it does not **wrap** anything, providing a **clean** surface API and future-proof from THREE.js version changes.

On the other hand, NGT is a **Component Library**, which means for almost every THREE.js entity, there is a corresponding entity (whether it is a Component or a Directive) in NGT. The bulk of the entities in NGT is **Single-Component-as-Module** to be best for Tree-shaking. For maintainability, NGT also **generates** most of these entities, which makes it possible to keep up with THREE.js version changes.

Rendering the THREE.js scene is done **outside** of the Angular Zone. In the future, when [Zone-less](https://angular.io/guide/roadmap#leverage-full-framework-capabilities-with-zonejs-opt-out) is available, NGT will be able to provide an even better experience to the consumers.

:::info

Zone-less is available today, but it requires more understanding and a lot of hoops to jump through to get it to work flawlessly.

:::

:::info

It is worth noting that R3F heavily inspires NGT. Many of the concepts and features of NGT are ported from R3F. You can call NGT an Angular-port of R3F.

:::tip

It is recommended that you should get familiar with [Angular](https://angular.io) and [THREE.js](https://threejs.org) before starting with NGT.

## What does the code look like?

We can take a peak at the code for the [Simple Cubes example](https://codesandbox.io/s/simple-cubes-dt4vy7?file=/src/app/app.component.html) here

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="appComponentHtml" label="app.component.html" default>

```html
<ngt-canvas>
    <ngt-ambient-light [intensity]="0.5"></ngt-ambient-light>
    <ngt-spot-light
        [position]="10"
        [angle]="0.15"
        [penumbra]="1"
    ></ngt-spot-light>
    <ngt-point-light [position]="-10"></ngt-point-light>

    <!-- power of a component framework, declarative express the scenegraph that has life-cycle hooks -->
    <app-cube [position]="[1.5, 0, 0]"></app-cube>
    <app-cube [position]="[-1.5, 0, 0]"></app-cube>
</ngt-canvas>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="appComponentTs" label="app.component.ts">

```ts
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cubeComponentHtml" label="cube.component.html">

```html
<ngt-mesh
    [position]="position"
    (pointerover)="hovered = true"
    (pointerout)="hovered = false"
    (click)="active = !active"
    [scale]="active ? 1.5 : 1"
    (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($event.object)"
>
    <ngt-box-geometry></ngt-box-geometry>
    <ngt-mesh-standard-material
        [color]="hovered ? 'turquoise' : 'tomato'"
    ></ngt-mesh-standard-material>
</ngt-mesh>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cubeComponentTs" label="cube.component.ts">

```ts
@Component({
    selector: 'app-cube',
    templateUrl: 'cube.component.html',
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class CubeComponent {
    // component that can accept Inputs
    @Input() position?: NgtVector3;

    // has internal state
    hovered = false;
    active = false;

    // registers the wrapped object in the animation loop that runs outside of Angular Zone
    onBeforeRender(cube: Mesh) {
        cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="appModuleTs" label="app.module.ts">

```ts
@NgModule({
    declarations: [AppComponent, CubeComponent],
    imports: [
        /* ... */
        // NGT is a highly modular library that follows Angular-library best practices
        NgtCanvasModule,
        NgtAmbientLightModule,
        NgtSpotLightModule,
        NgtPointLightModule,
        NgtMeshModule,
        NgtBoxGeometryModule,
        NgtMeshStandardMaterialModule,
    ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

and the result
