## Use NgZone as needed

Commonly, Angular reactivity is achieved by utilizing [Zone.js](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main/packages/zone.js) and Angular Core has a wrapper service around Zone.js called [NgZone](https://angular.io/api/core/NgZone).

In Angular Three, or any THREE.js applications, most of the actions happen inside of the root `<canvas>`. Hence, Angular's automatic change detection via Zone.js is _mostly_ unnecessary. To opt-out of Zone.js in our custom components, we can inject `NgZone` and run our logic in `runOutsideAngular()`

```ts
@Component({
  /*...*/
})
export class SceneComponent {
  constructor(private zone: NgZone) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      /* do logic like setting up Physics */
    });
  }
}
```

Most common use-cases are setting up Physics or updating Object3D's options.

## Use a `SceneComponent`

Everything in NGT needs to be rendered inside of a `<ngt-canvas>`. It is recommended that we should have a `SceneComponent` instead of laying out the Scene Graph directly under `<ngt-canvas>`

```html
<!-- instead of -->
<ngt-canvas>
  <ngt-ambient-light></ngt-ambient-light>
  <ngt-mesh></ngt-mesh>
  <ngt-soba-orbit-controls></ngt-soba-orbit-controls>
</ngt-canvas>

<!-- do this -->
<!-- scene.component.html -->
<ngt-ambient-light></ngt-ambient-light>
<ngt-mesh></ngt-mesh>
<ngt-soba-orbit-controls></ngt-soba-orbit-controls>

<!-- app.component.html -->
<ngt-canvas>
  <app-scene></app-scene>
</ngt-canvas>
```

The main reason is that there are some APIs (services) that are provided in **root** but there are some other APIs that are provided on the `<ngt-canvas>` component. By placing the Scene Graph in a single `SceneComponent` under `<ngt-canvas>`, we can make sure that all APIs can be injected in that **single SceneComponent** regardless of where the APIs are provided.

## Use `NgtComponentStore`

`NgtComponentStore` is a great way to make our component reactive and free of subscriptions. Check out [NgtComponentStore documentation](../../core/component-store)
