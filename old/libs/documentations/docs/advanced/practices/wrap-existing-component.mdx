It is common that we want to wrap some existing NGT's components and there are different use-cases for "wrapping" a component

## No Content Projection

We've seen this use-case before in [Out first scene](../../first-scene#making-our-cube-an-angular-component) where we put `<ngt-mesh>` in `CubeComponent`.

The catch here is that we **do not** intend to use Content Projection with `CubeComponent`

```html
<!-- this is all we do -->
<app-cube></app-cube>

<!-- this will not work -->
<app-cube>
  <ngt-mesh></ngt-mesh>
</app-cube>
```

Angular's Content Projection works a bit differently that what we might think. Here, `<ngt-mesh>` is _supposedly_ a child of `<app-cube>` but it is **not**. `<ngt-mesh>` is a child of the component whose template we are rendering (eg: `AppComponent`). In other words, our Scene Graph _might_ look correct (aka `<ngt-mesh>` should be a child of `<app-cube>`) but in reality `<ngt-mesh>` is on the same level as `<app-cube>`
