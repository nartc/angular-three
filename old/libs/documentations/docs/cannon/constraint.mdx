To interact with [Cannon Constraint API](https://pmndrs.github.io/cannon-es/docs/classes/Constraint.html), we use `NgtPhysicConstraint` service from `@angular-three/cannon`

## Usage

```ts
@Component({
  providers: [NgtPhysicConstraint],
})
export class BoxComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private physicConstraint: NgtPhysicConstraint) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // ðŸ‘‡ creating a Constraint between the two bodies
    this.physicConstraint.usePointToPointConstraint(refA, refB, someOptions);
  }
}
```

## Constraint Creators

| name                      | type             | options                      | description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| usePointToPointConstraint | `'PointToPoint'` | `PointToPointConstraintOpts` | Connects two bodies at given offset points.                                                                                     |
| useConeTwistConstraint    | `'ConeTwist'`    | `ConeTwistConstraintOpts`    | A Cone Twist constraint, useful for ragdolls.                                                                                   |
| useDistanceConstraint     | `'Distance'`     | `DistanceConstraintOpts`     | Constrains two bodies to be at a constant distance from each others center of mass.                                             |
| useHingeConstraint        | `'Hinge'`        | `HingeConstraintOpts`        | Hinge constraint. Think of it as a door hinge. It tries to keep the door in the correct place and with the correct orientation. |
| useLockConstraint         | `'Lock'`         | `LockConstraintOpts`         | Lock constraint. Will remove all degrees of freedom between the bodies.                                                         |

All Constraint Creators return `NgtPhysicConstraintReturn`

```ts
export interface NgtPhysicConstraintReturn<T extends 'Hinge' | ConstraintTypes> {
  bodyA: Ref<THREE.Object3D>;
  bodyB: Ref<THREE.Object3D>;
  api: NgtConstraintORHingeApi<T>;
}
```
