| quatNormalizeFast      | Set to `true` to use fast quaternion normalization. It is often enough accurate to use. If bodies tend to explode, set to `false`.                                                                                                                                   | `BooleanInput`           | `false`                             |
| quatNormalizeSkip      | How often to normalize quaternions. Set to `0` for every step, `1` for every second etc.. A larger value increases performance. If bodies tend to explode, set to a smaller value (zero to be sure nothing can go wrong).                                            | `NumberInput`            | `0`                                 |

| axisIndex              | For `SAPBroadphase`, axis to sort the bodies along. Set to `0` for x axis, and `1` for y axis. For best performance, pick the axis where bodies are most distributed.                                                                                                | `0`, `1`, or `2`         | `0`                                 |
| defaultContactMaterial | Properties to pass in the `World.defaultContactMaterial` as options                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `ContactMaterialOptions` | `{ contactEquationStiffness: 1e6 }` |

```ts
type ContactMaterialOptions = {
  friction?: number;
  restitution?: number;
  contactEquationStiffness?: number;
  contactEquationRelaxation?: number;
  frictionEquationStiffness?: number;
  frictionEquationRelaxation?: number;
};
```

### Broadphases

- NaiveBroadphase is as simple as it gets. It considers every body to be a potential collider with every other body. This results in the maximum number of narrowphase checks.
- SAPBroadphase sorts bodies along an axis and then moves down that list finding pairs by looking at body size and position of the next bodies. Control what axis to sort along by setting the axisIndex property.
