[cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) is a lightweight 3D physics engine written in JavaScript. [cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es) is a fork that provides ESM and CJS to support modern JS tooling.

The same team [Poimandres](https://github.com/pmndrs) provides the [Web Worker version of CannonES](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-cannon/tree/master/packages/cannon-worker-api) which NGT is utilizing for `@angular-three/cannon`

## Installation

```shell
npm install @angular-three/cannon
```
