Throughout the documentations, we will encounter many types of Inputs that NGT works with. This page attempts to explain those types

## Constructor Arguments

While consulting THREE.js documentations, we will come across objects that can be constructed by passing in different arguments in the constructor.

```ts
const sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
```

NGT supports **Constructor Arguments** by providing `[args]` Input on various objects

```html
<ngt-sphere-geometry [args]="[1, 32, 32]"></ngt-sphere-geometry>
```

:::caution

NGT objects that use `[args]` will be reconstructed when `[args]` changes

:::

## Options

Along with **Constructor Arguments**, an object might have a list of Inputs that object accepts as **options**. Options are usually optional when constructing said THREE.js object and will **not** reconstruct the object upon changed.

```ts
const light = new THREE.AmbientLight('white', 1); // color and intensity
// or
const secondLight = new THREE.AmbientLight();
secondLight.color.set('white');
secondLight.intensity = 1;
```

NGT supports similar concept

```html
<ngt-ambient-light color="white" intensity="1"></ngt-ambient-light>
```

:::caution

When to use **Constructor Arguments** versus when to use **options** is a case-by-case decision as we work on our scene graph.

### Shortcuts

In the previous example about `THREE.AmbientLight`, we see that we use `color.set()` to set the color of the light. Such method (`set()`) is a _shortcut_. NGT attempts to call the _shortcut_ methods automatically on various options: `position`, `color`, `scale`, `rotation` etc...

### `BooleanInput`

In Angular, we would have to pass `true` or `false` to a `boolean` Input

```html
<ngt-mesh [castShadow]="true"></ngt-mesh>
```

`BooleanInput` allows us to pass in different variants for `boolean` Input

```html
<ngt-mesh [castShadow]="true"></ngt-mesh>
<ngt-mesh castShadow></ngt-mesh>
<ngt-mesh castShadow=""></ngt-mesh>
```

### `NumberInput`

In Angular, we would have to pass in a `number` to a `number` Input

```html
<ngt-ambient-light [intensity]="1"></ngt-ambient-light>
```

`NumberInput` allows us to pass in different variants for `number` Input

```html
<ngt-ambient-light [intensity]="1"></ngt-ambient-light>

<ngt-ambient-light intensity="1"></ngt-ambient-light>
```

### `Ngt***`

Throughout the documentations, we will come across `NgtVector3`, `NgtEuler` etc... These are NGT versions of THREE.js counterparts:

- `NgtVector3` -> `THREE.Vector3`
- `NgtEuler` -> `THREE.Euler`
- ...

Because NGT automatically deals with [Shortcuts](#shortcuts), NGT provides more relaxed types for these Inputs

```html
<!--                  ðŸ‘‡ instead of constructing THREE.Vector3(1, 2, 3) -->
<ngt-mesh [position]="[1, 2, 3]"></ngt-mesh>
<!--                ðŸ‘‡ instead of constructing THREE.Vector3(1.5, 1.5, 1.5) -->
<ngt-mesh [scale]="1.5"></ngt-mesh>
```
