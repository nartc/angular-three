`Ref` is an object that wraps [`BehaviorSubject`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/BehaviorSubject) to provide reactivity to all the objects inside of THREE and Angular Three.
In NGT, `Ref`s are passed around instead of the raw object value because we want to maintain the same instance of the object as well as observability of the object itself
(aka when it finishes initialized)

`Ref` has the following API

```ts
Ref<Value> {
    get ref$(): Observable<Value>; // the underlying Observable of the BehaviorSubject
    get value(): Value; // the raw value that the Ref is holding
    set(value: Value): void; // set AND notify all subscribers that the ref is updated
    complete(): void; // stop all emissions. the ref is finalized
}
```
