NGT state is tracked by a single `NgtStore`. Each `NgtCanvas` instance contains its own instance of `NgtStore` so each scene graph has its independent state.

All `NgtInstance` injects `NgtStore` so all NGT objects essentially have access to the Canvas state object. Any custom components inside of `<ngt-canvas>` can also inject `NgtStore` and use its state.

## Accessing states

`NgtStore` is a [`NgtComponentStore`](./component-store) so there are both Reactive and Imperative approaches to access the state.

### Reactive

```ts
this.store.select(); // reacts to the whole state object
this.store.select((s) => s.camera); // reacts to the top-level property
this.store.select((s) => s.events.enabled); // reacts to deep property
```

### Imperative

```ts
this.store.get(); // gets the whole state at the time of invoking
this.store.get((s) => s.camera); // gets the top-level property at the time of invoking
this.store.get((s) => s.events.enabled); // gets the deep property at the time of invoking
```

:::tip

- `select()` is mainly used as parameters to side-effects. When something changes, we want to re-run the side-effects
- `get()` is usually used in animation loop callback where the state gets the latest value per frame

## Registering before render callbacks

We can use `NgtStore` to register callbacks to be run before every renders (aka the animation) by calling `registerBeforeRender()` on the `NgtStore`

```ts
export class CubeComponent extends NgtInstance {
  ngOnInit() {
    // ðŸ‘‡ this is available on all NgtInstance
    const unregister = this.store.registerBeforeRender(/* NgtBeforeRenderRecord */);
    // this returns the clean up function. call unregister() to unsubscribe from the animation loop, preventing memory leak
  }
}
```

### `NgtBeforeRenderRecord`

`registerBeforeRender()` accepts an object in the shape of `NgtBeforeRenderRecord`

- `callback`: the only required property. This is the callback that would be called before every render, outside of Angular Zone. `callback` is called with the same arguments as [`(beforeRender)`](./objects#beforerender-output)
- `obj`: optional `Ref<THREE.Object3D>` or `THREE.Object3D`.
- `priority`: optional [Render Priority](#render-priority)

### Render Priority

By default, NGT renders the scene automatically on every frame. If we need more control over the render-loop, we may pass in the `priority` property on **ANY** `registerBeforeRender()` and NGT will disable the automatic render altogether. It is our responsibility to render now, which is useful when we're working with things like `EffectComposer`

```ts
this.store.registerBeforeRender({
  callback: ({ gl, scene, camera }) => {
    gl.render(scene, camera);
  },
  priority: 1,
});

this.store.registerBeforeRender({
  callback: ({ gl, scene, camera }) => {
    // this executes AFTER the above callback
    gl.render(/* ... */);
  },
  priority: 2,
});
```

:::tip

For registering before render callbacks with `(beforeRender)` on the template, there is [`[priority]`](./objects#priority-input)

:::

### Negative Priority

We can also pass in negative numerical value to `priority`. Negative value will **not** stop the automatic render but is useful for ordering callbacks.

```ts
this.store.registerBeforeRender({
  callback: () => {
    // this will be executed last
  },
  priority: -1,
});

this.store.registerBeforeRender({
  callback: () => {
    // this will be executed AFTER the above callback
  },
  priority: -2,
});
```
