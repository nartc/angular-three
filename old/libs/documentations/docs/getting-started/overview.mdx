## What is Angular Three (NGT) ?

NGT is a **Component Library** that wraps around [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) to provide a declarative approach to building 3D applications using [Angular](https://angular.io/) capabilities.

## Why is it good to use NGT ?

NGT allows the consumers to utilize Template-less Directives to build 3D scenes declaratively with access to Angular Dependency Injection, Inputs, Outputs, and other standard features.

## How does NGT work?

NGT relies heavily on [Hierarchical Dependency Injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection) to allow for declarative creation of THREE.js objects on the template.

## What is the difference between NGT and React Three Fiber?

Many points in comparison with R3F, which are listed here, in [Svelte Cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/docs/faqs#how-is-it-different-from-x-react-three-fiber) (a Svelte-based THREE.js library) also applies to NGT.

[React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (R3F) is a **Renderer** that treats THREE.js as native elements. Hence, it does not **wrap** anything, providing a **clean** surface API and future-proof from THREE.js version changes.

On the other hand, NGT is a **Component Library**, which means for almost every THREE.js entity, there is a corresponding entity (whether it is a Component or a Directive) in NGT. The bulk of the entities in NGT is **Single-Component-as-Module** to be best for Tree-shaking. For maintainability, NGT also **generates** most of these entities, which makes it possible to keep up with THREE.js version changes.

Rendering the THREE.js scene is done **outside** of the Angular Zone. In the future, when [Zone-less](https://angular.io/guide/roadmap#leverage-full-framework-capabilities-with-zonejs-opt-out) is available, NGT will be able to provide an even better experience to the consumers.

:::info

Zone-less is available today, but it requires more understanding and a lot of hoops to jump through to get it to work flawlessly.

:::

:::info

It is worth noting that R3F heavily inspires NGT. Many of the concepts and features of NGT are ported from R3F. You can call NGT an Angular-port of R3F.

:::

:::tip

It is recommended that you should get familiar with [Angular](https://angular.io) and [THREE.js](https://threejs.org) before starting with NGT.

## What does the code look like?

We can take a peak at the code for the [Simple Cubes example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-hxkcf9?file=src/app/app.component.ts) here

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="appComponentHtml" label="app.component.html" default>

```html
<ngt-canvas>
  <ngt-ambient-light intensity="0.5"></ngt-ambient-light>
  <ngt-spot-light [position]="10" angle="0.15" penumbra="1"></ngt-spot-light>
  <ngt-point-light [position]="-10"></ngt-point-light>

  <!-- power of a component framework, declarative express the scenegraph that has life-cycle hooks -->
  <app-cube [position]="[1.5, 0, 0]"></app-cube>
  <app-cube [position]="[-1.5, 0, 0]"></app-cube>
</ngt-canvas>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="appComponentTs" label="app.component.ts">

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
  imports: [NgtCanvas, NgtAmbientLight, NgtSpotLight, NgtPointLight, CubeComponent]
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cubeComponentHtml" label="cube.component.html">

```html
<ngt-mesh
  [position]="position"
  (pointerover)="hovered = true"
  (pointerout)="hovered = false"
  (click)="active = !active"
  [scale]="active ? 1.5 : 1"
  (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($event.object)"
>
  <ngt-box-geometry></ngt-box-geometry>
  <ngt-mesh-standard-material [color]="hovered ? 'turquoise' : 'tomato'"></ngt-mesh-standard-material>
</ngt-mesh>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cubeComponentTs" label="cube.component.ts">

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-cube',
  standalone: true,
  templateUrl: 'cube.component.html',
  imports: [NgtMesh, NgtBoxGeometry, NgtMeshStandardMaterial],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class CubeComponent {
  // component that can accept Inputs
  @Input() position?: NgtVector3;

  // has internal state
  hovered = false;
  active = false;

  // registers the wrapped object in the animation loop that runs outside of Angular Zone
  onBeforeRender(cube: Mesh) {
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mainTs" label="main.ts">

```ts
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent);
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

and the result

:::note

Since Angular Three v6, all examples are written with Angular Standalone APIs

Do not worry. We will get to the details of the code in later sections.
