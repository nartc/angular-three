`@angular-three/core@5` contains many breaking changes. This guide is to list all the breaking changes, removals, and deprecations in no particular order. Please give it a thorough read.

## API Removals

### `clock` Input

`<ngt-canvas [clock]>` Input is removed.

### `size` Input

`<ngt-canvas [size]>` Input is removed.

### `vr` Input

Previously, `[vr]` Input on the `<ngt-canvas>` was used to let NGT knows that a scene should be using WebXR. Now, NGT should automatically switch to use WebXR if a VR session is requested.

```diff
- <ngt-canvas [vr]="true"></ngt-canvas>
+ <ngt-canvas></ngt-canvas>
```

### Controllers

All `controllers` are removed as the core of Angular Three has been rewritten to use Abstractions with Dependency Injection instead. The Controller approach worked but the trade-off for DX was too big. (eg: auto importing modules is broken, hard to remember and extend etc...)

### Physics Bodies

All Physics Bodies directives are removed. Check [NgtPhysicBody](#ngtphysicbody) for more information on replacement.

### Physics Constraints

All Physics Constraints directives are removed. Check [NgtPhysicConstraint](#ngtphysicconstraint) for more information on replacement.

### `exportAs`

Previously, most objects in NGT were `Directive` and `exportAs` was used to expose the Directive instances. Now, most objects are `Component` instead as using `Directive` didn't provide any additional benefit and `exportAs` was unnecessary boilerplate.

```diff
- <ngt-mesh #mesh="ngtMesh"></ngt-mesh>
+ <ngt-mesh #mesh></ngt-mesh>
```

### Instance getters

Previously, most NGT objects exposed a getter to get the instance for the corresponding type of object. For example:

- `NgtCommonMesh` exposes `get mesh()`
- `NgtCommonMaterial` exposes `get material()`
- `NgtCommonGeometry` exposes `get geometry()`

Now, we can grab the `get instance()` from **ALL** NGT objects instead. However, `instance` returns a `Ref`. To get the underlying instance, use `instance.value`

```html
<ngt-plane-geometry #plane></ngt-plane-geometry> <ngt-mesh-standard-material #standard></ngt-mesh-standard-material>
```

```diff
- <ngt-mesh [geometry]="plane.geometry" [material]="standard.material"></ngt-mesh>
+ <ngt-mesh [geometry]="plane.instance" [material]="standard.instance"></ngt-mesh>
+ <!-- or, both works the same -->
+ <ngt-mesh [geometry]="plane.instance.value" [material]="standard.instance.value"></ngt-mesh>
```

### Stores

`NgtCanvasStore`, `NgtAnimationFrameStore`, `NgtEventsStore` are removed in favor of a single `NgtStore` that tracks **ALL** states in the Canvas.

#### `NgtAnimationFrameStore`

Previously, `NgtAnimationFrameStore#register` (and `NgtAnimationFrameStore#unregister`) were used to register (and unregister) a callback to the animation loop. Now, `NgtStore#registerBeforeRender` (and `NgtStore#unregisterBeforeRender`) does that job.

```diff
- const uuid = this.animationFrameStore.register({/* ... */});
- this.animationFrameStore.unregister(uuid);
+ const unregister = this.store.registerBeforeRender({/* ... */});
+ unregister();
```

### `NgtPerformance`

`NgtPerformance` is removed. Performance related states and methods are now belonged to `NgtStore`.

```diff
- this.performance.regress();
+ const performance = this.store.get(s => s.performance);
+ performance.regress();
```

### `NgtLoop`

`NgtLoop` is removed. `invalidate()` call is now belonged to `NgtStore`

```diff
- this.loop.invalidate();
+ const invalidate = this.store.get(s => s.invalidate);
+ invalidate();
```

### `NgtDestroyed`

`NgtDestroyed` is removed. All instances now expose `destroy$` stream that can be used to be notified of when the underlying instance is _destroyed_.

```diff
@Directive({
-   providers: [NgtDestroyed]
})
export class SomeDirective {
    constructor(
        object: NgtObject,
-       destroyed: NgtDestroyed
    ) {
        object.click.pipe(
-           takeUntil(destroyed)
+           takeUntil(object.destroy$)
        )
    }
}
```

### `NgtMathConstantPipe`

`NgtMathConstantPipe` is removed. If you are using `mathConst:'PI'`, use `NgtPiPipe` instead.

## API Deprecations

### `NgtCoreModule`

`NgtCoreModule` has been deprecated in favor of `NgtCanvasModule`. `NgtCoreModule` was confusing because it does not expose any other components/directives rather than `NgtCanvas`.

```diff
- imports: [NgtCoreModule]
+ imports: [NgtCanvasModule]
```

### `animateReady`

`(animateReady)` has been deprecated in favor of `(beforeRender)`. This is a rename to be consistent with THREE.js term.

```diff
- <ngt-mesh (animateReady)="onAnimateReady($event)"></ngt-mesh>
+ <ngt-mesh (beforeRender)="onAnimateReady($event)"></ngt-mesh>
```

### `[parameters]` on Materials

Previously, any material directive accepted a `[parameters]` Input to customize that material. Now, each material has their own set of Inputs that can be used instead.

```diff
- <ngt-mesh-standard-material [parameters]="{ color: 'blue' }"></ngt-mesh-standard-material>
+ <ngt-mesh-standard-material color="blue"></ngt-mesh-standard-material>
```

### `NgtColorPipe`

`NgtColorPipe` has been deprecated. Use `NgtColorAttribute` with `attach` instead

```diff
- <ngt-canvas [scene]="{ background: 'blue' | color }"></ngt-canvas>
+ <ngt-canvas>
+     <ngt-color attach="background" color="blue"></ngt-color>
+ </ngt-canvas>
```

### `NgtFogPipe`

`NgtFogPipe` has been deprecated. Use `NgtFogAttribute` with `attach` instead

```diff
- <ngt-canvas [scene]="{ fog: [] | fog }"></ngt-canvas>
+ <ngt-canvas>
+     <ngt-fog attach="fog" [fog]="[]"></ngt-fog>
+ </ngt-canvas>
```

### `NgtFogExp2Pipe`

`NgtFogExp2Pipe` has been deprecated. Use `NgtFogExp2Attribute` with `attach` instead

```diff
- <ngt-canvas [scene]="{ fog: [] | fogExp2 }"></ngt-canvas>
+ <ngt-canvas>
+     <ngt-fog-exp2 attach="fog" [fogExp2]="[]"></ngt-fog>
+ </ngt-canvas>
```

### `NgtVector*Pipe`

`NgtVector*Pipe` has been deprecated. Use `NgtVector*Attribute` with `attach` instead

```diff
- <ngt-directional-light [shadow]="{ mapSize: [2048, 2048] | vector2 }"></ngt-directional-light>
+ <ngt-directional-light>
+     <ngt-vector2 [attach]="['shadow', 'mapSize']" [vector2]="2048"></ngt-vector2>
+ </ngt-directional-light>
```

## API Breaking Changes

### `appendTo` and `appendMode`

`[appendTo]` is an Input that is used to tell NGT where to append the Object3D. Previously, `[appendTo]` accepted either a `THREE.Object3D` instance or a `() => THREE.Object3D` factory. Now, `[appendTo]` accepts a `Ref<THREE.Object3D> | THREE.Object3D` instead (read more about [Ref documentation](../core/ref)). If a `THREE.Object3D` is passed in, that `THREE.Object3D` will be used to create a new `Ref`.

Previously, `appendTo` override `appendMode` except for `appendMode = 'none'`. Now, `appendTo` skips `appendMode` completely regardless of `appendMode` value.

### `@angular-three/cannon` Worker API

Previously, `@angular-three/cannon` shipped its own version of the Cannon API in a Web Worker. Now, `@angular-three/cannon` is using the framework-agnostic [@pmndrs/cannon-web-worker](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-cannon/tree/master/packages/cannon-worker-api).

If you have already been using `@angular-three/cannon` with `tsconfig.worker.json`, please remove `tsconfig.worker.json` (if you don't need it anymore) and remove all references to `tsconfig.worker.json` in your project.

### `NgtPhysicBody`

Instead of individual directive that can be attached on the template, Body is now an `Injectable` named `NgtPhysicBody`

```diff
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh
-           ngtPhysicBox
-           [getPhysicProps]="getBoxProps"
+           [ref]="boxRef.ref"
        ></ngt-mesh>
    `,
+   providers: [NgtPhysicBody]
})
export class SomeComponent {
-   getBoxProps: GetByIndex<BoxProps> = () => ({/* ... */});

+   boxRef = this.physicBody.useBox(() => ({/* ... */}));
+   constructor(private physicBody: NgtPhysicBody) {}
}
```

To use the `NgtPhysicsBodyPublicApi`, you can use: `this.boxRef.api`

:::caution

`NgtPhysicBody` depends on `NgtStore` (from `ngt-canvas`) and `NgtPhysicsStore` (from `ngt-physics`) so make sure the component that is providing `NgtPhysicBody` needs to be inside of `ngt-canvas` and `ngt-physics`.

:::

### `NgtPhysicConstraint`

Instead of individual directive that can be attached on the template, Constraint is now an `Injectable` named `NgtPhysicConstraint`

```diff
@Component({
    template: `
-       <ng-container ngtPhysicPointToPointConstraint>
-           <ngt-mesh ngtPhysicBox [getPhysicProps]="getBoxProps"></ngt-mesh>
-           <ngt-mesh> ngtPhysicPlane [getPhysicProps]="getPlaneProps"</ngt-mesh>
-       </ng-container>
+       <ngt-mesh [ref]="boxRef.ref"></ngt-mesh>
+       <ngt-mesh [ref]="planeRef.ref"></ngt-mesh>
    `,
+   providers: [NgtPhysicConstraint, NgtPhysicBody]
})
export class SomeComponent {

+   boxRef = this.physicBody.useBox();
+   planeRef = this.physicBody.usePlane();

+   constructor(
+       private physicConstraint: NgtPhysicConstraint,
+       private physicBody: NgtPhysicBody
+   ) {
+   }

+   ngOnInit() {
+       this.physicConstraint.usePointToPointConstraint(this.boxRef.ref, this.planeRef.ref);
+   }
}
```

:::caution

`NgtPhysicConstraint` depends on `NgtStore` (from `ngt-canvas`) and `NgtPhysicsStore` (from `ngt-physics`) so make sure the component that is providing `NgtPhysicConstraint` needs to be inside of `ngt-canvas` and `ngt-physics`.
