## Compatibility Table

NGT makes use of different libraries in the THREE.js ecosystem. Check the version of all the libraries before installing is always a good thing to do.

| NGT Version | Angular Version                 | THREE Version    | RxJS Version |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| <= ^4.0.0   | ^13.0.0                         | ~0.137           | ^7.0.0       |
| >= ^5.0.0   | ^13.0.0                         | ~0.140 \| ~0.141 | ^7.0.0       |
| >= ^6.0.0   | ^14.1.0 (make sure it is 14.1+) | ~0.141 \| ~0.142 | ^7.0.0       |

:::tip

NGT tries to stay on a version of THREE.js that has the corresponding type definitions. To figure out which is the latest version of THREE.js that NGT supports, look at the version of `@types/three`. We can _safely_ assume that patch versions are safe to update to.

### 3rd Party libraries

These libraries are installed as `dependencies` when we install a specific NGT library.

| NGT Library                     | 3rd Party library           |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `@angular-three/soba`           | `three-stdlib`              |
|                                 | `troika-three-text`         |
| `@angular-three/cannon`         | `cannon-es`                 |
|                                 | `cannon-es-debugger`        |
|                                 | `@pmndrs/cannon-worker-api` |
| `@angular-three/postprocessing` | `postprocessing`            |

## Installation

### Automatic

For Angular CLI projects, run the following command:

```shell
ng add @angular-three/schematics
```

For [Nx Dev Tools](https://nx.dev) users, run the following commands:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @angular-three/schematics
npx nx generate @angular-three/schematics:init
```

The generator (schematic) installs `three`, `@types/three`, and `@angular-three/core`. It also turns on `skipLibCheck: true` in the root `tsconfig.json`. This is required for other libraries' usage like: soba or postprocessing because their dependencies will fail strict type checking.

### Manual

NGT is a collection of packages that provide different Angular counterparts for different areas of THREE.js. To get started, we only need `@angular-three/core` and `three` (and its type definition `@types/three`)

```shell
npm install @angular-three/core three@~0.142
npm install --save-dev @types/three@~0.142
```

Next, go to the root `tsconfig.json` (or `tsconfig.base.json` in an Nx Workspace project) and add `skipLibCheck: true` to the `compilerOptions`

### Ecosystem

- `@angular-three/core`: THREE.js core entities. Most of the exports from `THREE` namespace are provided by **core** package.
- `@angular-three/soba`: A set of helpers, utilities, and extra entities ported from [React Three Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei).
- `@angular-three/postprocessing`: A set of post-processing effects with `EffectComposer` and other effects from [postprocessing](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing).
- `@angular-three/cannon`: Physics support for NGT, ported from [React Three Cannon](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-cannon)
