# Services

In addition to the Component Stores, there are also a number of services that are available

| Service             | Scope            |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| NgtDestroyedService | Any Component    |
| NgtLoopService      | CanvasComponent  |
| NgtResize           | Any Component    |
| NgtLoaderService    | Root (Singleton) |

## `NgtDestroyedService`

This service is a utility service that can be used in combination with `takeUntil` so the consumers don't need to create their own `destroyed` subject.

```ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
  providers: [NgtDestroyedService],
})
export class SomeComponent {
  constructor(private destroyed: NgtDestroyedService) {
    interval(1000).pipe(takeUntil(destroyed)).subscribe();
  }
}
```

## `NgtLoopService`

This service handles the starting and stopping of the animation loop. This is **internal** to NGT but exposed to use in other parts of the library.

## `NgtResize`

This service is a utility service that can be used on any component that wants to watch for resize events.

```ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
  providers: [NgtResize],
})
export class SomeComponent {
  constructor(
    @Inject(NgtResize)
    private resizeResult$: Observable<NgtResizeResult>
  ) {
    this.resizeResult$.subscribe(); // emit everytime the window/host is resized
  }
}
```

```ts
export interface NgtResizeResult {
  readonly entries: ReadonlyArray<ResizeObserverEntry>;
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
  readonly width: number;
  readonly height: number;
  readonly top: number;
  readonly right: number;
  readonly bottom: number;
  readonly left: number;
  readonly dpr: number;
}
```

The default resize options are:

```ts
{
  box: 'content-box',
  scroll: false,
  offsetSize: false,
  debounce: 200,
}
```

We can provide our own options via `NGT_RESIZE_OPTIONS` on the component that uses `NgtResize`

```ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
  providers: [
    NgtResize,
    {
      provide: NGT_RESIZE_OPTIONS,
      useValue: {
        // have to provide the whole options object as they're not merged at the moment
        debounce: 500,
        scroll: false,
        box: 'content-box',
        offsetSize: false,
      },
    },
  ],
})
export class SomeComponent {
  constructor(
    @Inject(NgtResize)
    private resizeResult$: Observable<NgtResizeResult>
  ) {
    this.resizeResult$.subscribe(); // emit everytime the window/host is resized
  }
}
```

## `NgtLoaderService`

This service is used to load external resources. This is recommended as it is type-safe as well as it has an internal caching mechanism to make sure not to load the same resource multiple times.

`NgtLoaderService` is a singleton and can be injected into any component regardless of `ngt-canvas` or not.

```ts
export class SomeComponent {
  model$ = this.loaderService.use(GTLFLoader, 'path/to/model.gltf'); // Observable<GLTF>

  constructor(private loaderService: NgtLoaderService) {}
}
```
