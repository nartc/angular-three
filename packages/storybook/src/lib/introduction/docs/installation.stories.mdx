## Installation

NGT is a collection of packages that provide difference area of THREE.js. To get started, you only need `@angular-three/core` and its `peerDependencies`

### Using `ng add`

`@angular-three/core` provides `ng add` schematic to quickly add it to our project

```shell
ng add @angular-three/core
# nx
npm install @angular-three/core
npx nx generate @angular-three/core:init
```

### Manual

```shell
npm install @angular-three/core
#or yarn
yarn add @angular-three/core
```

Manual installation also requires that the following `peerDependencies` are installed. You will need to install the THREE.js library and its types:

```shell
npm install three@0.135
npm install -D @types/three@0.135
# or yarn
yarn add three@0.135
yarn add -D @types/three@0.135
```

> NGT will always try to stay on a version of THREE.js that has the corresponding typing definitions for.

You will also need to manually install `@ngrx/component-store`:

```shell
npm install @ngrx/component-store
# or yarn
yarn add @ngrx/component-store
```

**Why?**

> `@ngrx/component-store` is extremely lightweight. It is also well-tested. I decided to keep it as a peerDependency because the consumers can actually make use of `@ngrx/component-store` if they find a need for it. After all, it's just a **Subject-as-a-Service**, but supercharged. The consumers will definitely gain more than what they have to pay for `@ngrx/component-store`.

## Ecosystem

- `@angular-three/core`: THREE.js core entities. Most of the exports from `THREE` namespace are provided by **core** package.
- `@angular-three/soba`\_: A set of helpers, utilities, and extra entities that are complimentary to `@angular-three/core`. Also, **soba** provides THREE.js entities that are from `three/examples/*` via [three-stdlib](https://github.com/pmndrs/three-stdlib) for better tree-shakability.
- `@angular-three/postprocessing`\*: A set of post-processing effects with `EffectComposer` and other effects from [postprocessing](https://github.com/vanruesc/postprocessing).
- `@angular-three/cannon`: Physics support for NGT, ported from [React Three Cannon](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-cannon)
